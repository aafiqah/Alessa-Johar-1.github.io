# About

Hi! My name is Alessa and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in mobile development started back in 2020 when I having assignment for Programming for Mobile subject by creating android application â€” turns out hacking together an android development taught me a lot about Android & Flutter!

Throughout my university years, I undertook several impactful projects by creating various development including desktop & android application. After having a Bachelor's in Computer Forensic, I've decided to take the leap to pursue a career in Mobile Developer. I love to learn new technologies and flex my creativity to create amazing things. Besides my passion for coding, I love to travel, photography, and editing video.
